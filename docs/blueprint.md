## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated green (#4CAF50) to evoke the excitement and vibrancy of the game.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F1F8E9), close to the primary color, creates a subtle, pleasant backdrop.
- Accent color: Blue (#2196F3) for interactive elements, such as buttons and links.  Provides excellent contrast against the green background and attracts user attention.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' provides a computerized, techy feel that evokes sport, while 'Inter' ensures body text is highly readable.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying API endpoints and data structures.
- Desktop: 2-column layout â€“ left timeline and score, right video/highlights and live stats. Mobile: Stacked layout with sticky header showing match score.
- Use sports-themed icons, such as soccer balls, whistles, and timers.
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations on score updates and event triggers for engagement.
